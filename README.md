# csci4448

This is my repository for CSCI 4448 that includes my semester project.

IMPORTANT: I have uploaded an audio file along with my jing video for part 5 and they're both in sync.

There are too many files for me to just put in the main github page. It would over crowd this main page.

All of my project code lies in the project/ folder and the code is in mysite/ in the following files: home\_html.txt, cart\_html.txt, login\_html.txt, signup\_html.txt, 686\_jacket\_html.txt, bat\_board\_html.txt, burt\_mittens\_html.txt, line\_skis\_html.txt, vol\_jacket\_html.txt, von\_goggles\_html.txt. 
My Database is in project/mysite/ and its called db.sqlite3.
There is also code in mysite/mywebsite/ in the following files: urls.py, views.py, customer.py, item.py, and payment.py

There is alot of other code in there that exists for the framework, when I downloaded Django.
