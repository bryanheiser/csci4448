# csci4448

This is my repository for CSCI 4448 that includes my semester project.

Imprtant: My audio was not working for Jing, so I have a text file called text\_for\_video.txt that has what I was going to talk about.

My project code lies in the project folder and the code is in mysite/mywebsite/views.py, mysite/mywebsite/urls.py, and mysite/mysite/urls.py.
There is other code in there that exists for the framework, when I downloaded Django.
