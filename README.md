# csci4448

This is my repository for CSCI 4448 that includes my semester project.

IMPORTANT: Again, my audio was not working for Jing even with an external mic, so I have a text file called text\_for\_video.txt that has what I was going to talk about.

My project code lies in the project folder and the code is in mysite/ in the following files: home\_html.txt, cart\_html.txt, login\_html.txt, signup\_html.txt. There is also code in mysite/mywebsite/ in the following files: customer.py, item.py, and payment.py
There is other code in there that exists for the framework, when I downloaded Django.
